/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for HackEval application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes authorization independence by denormalizing data, allowing for simpler and more performant rules.
 * It leverages Anonymous Authentication for jury members, with access primarily governed by the Firebase Auth service.
 * Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /teams/{teamId}: Stores information about each team.
 * - /scores/{teamId}: Stores scores given to a team by jury members.
 * - /juries/{juryId}: Stores information about jury members.
 * - /appConfig/loginBackground: Stores configuration for the app, like the login background URL.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Jury member access to scoring is granted via Anonymous Authentication, with no reliance on custom claims or complex role hierarchies.
 * - Write operations to the `/scores/{teamId}` collection happen with the `request.auth.uid` parameter.
 * - No user listing is allowed for any collection unless specified.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `/scores/{teamId}` collection includes the `teamId`, allowing direct association between scores and teams without needing to perform `get()` operations.
